The Roman Empire is expanding rapidly. Outposts are coming up faster than ever before but they are under pressure from all sides. Protect your citizens from barbarians, build aqueducts, launch counterattacks across the border, obey your Caesar's commands.

Extend the reach of civilization from the comfort of your terminal.

Will you rise to the purple?
