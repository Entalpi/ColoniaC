Gameplay components

** Power: Political, Diplomatic, Civic, Military
   Power represents the abstract ability of the state in various regards. The capacity controls
   the 'width' of the state or rather the size of the bureacracy.

   Poltical power is the state's ability to enforce its policies and to which degree they are effective.
   By spending more poiltical power behind an effort the effects are controlled. 


 - Politcal power can be negative which increases the risk of harmful events such as ...
 ... generals disobeying order(s)
 ... riots
 ... plebian work strikes
 ... murders of politicians (decreases polticla capacity permentanly)
 ... 


** Constructions

Feedback chains

 - Short


 - Medium
) Unlocking new constructions enables progression
) Moderating the numbers through various means
 - What means? 
) 

 - Long
) Events change the gamescape, by changing the effectiviness of various game elements, thus ensuring 
that tweaks to the state is always neccessary and thereby providing opportunity for gameplay over 
the course of game's length.
 
 - Game length/over life time of game
Explicit goals unlike EU4 is to prevent the collapse of Rome thus making the game time infinite.
Historically the times will change very little (no modern inventations except contempory ancient ones).

         ... so that I can fund the war effort in the against Carthage
Long-term goals?
- Ex #1) Preventing the collapse of Rome (as a nation)
